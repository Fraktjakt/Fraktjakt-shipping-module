Configuration Possibilities with Fraktjakt
==========================================
	Selection of which shipping services your customers may choose when they make purchases in your web shop;

	Selection of whether shipping time will be displayed as Number of days or Arrival time; 
	Selection of Free shipping when a customer's purchase exceeds a specific amount;
	Setting a price for picking up a product in person instead of having it shipped; 
	Definition of optional standard box dimensions, if you want Fraktjakt to use these;
	Selection of which days shippers can pick up products for delivery;
	Definition of pick-up times, if applicable.


Useful functions 
================
	Fraktjakt can handle all products in the customer's shopping cart, regardless of whether they are sent as separate 
	parcels or if multiple products are packaged together in a standard box. 
	Fraktjakt allows you to define the dimensions of individual products. This provides more exact price calculations.
	Fraktjakt can determine which products in your customer's shopping cart will fit into your standard boxes and base 
	the shipping prices on your standard box size. This is normally cheaper than basing the shipping prices on the 
	dimensions of your individual products.  
	Fraktjakt estimates delivery times based on your settings, i.e. which days shippers can come and pick up products for delivery, 
	along with any specific pick-up times that you may have defined. 
	Your customers only see the shipping alternatives that you want them to be able to choose. 
	When your customers choose delivery that is not door-to-door, they are shown the nearest pick-up location and 
	how far it is from their address to that location.
	Fraktjakt provides links to maps that help your customers locate pick-up locations.
	Fraktjakt prepares booking and pick-up of one or more shipments. 
	Frakt creates shipping documents for both domestic and international shipments, to be printed out on your own printer.
